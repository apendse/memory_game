# memory game 

A card game that tests your memory.
All the cards are laid face down at the start. You flip two cards and if they match (same value) then you made progress. If not you try again.
The matched cards are shown face up. Your goal is to match all the cards and make the whole deck face up with minimum number of guesses.
